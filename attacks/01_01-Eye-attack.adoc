= Attack Eye 01-01

== Attack type
Eye, printed photo attack

=== Total Number of Species
This attack has *2* species to be tested.

== Overview
The evaluator captures and prints target user's eye on the paper and present it to the TOE.

== Input
Target userâ€™s eyes are open and iris is mostly visible

== Tools
*Normal Quality*

* T.1a, Type 1
* T.2, Type 1
* M.1, Type 1

== Recipe
. The evaluator shall capture the eye image and print it on a paper. 
. The evaluator shall refer publicly available information to change default setting of the camera (e.g. image resolution) and printer (e.g. resolution) to create clearer eye artefacts.
. The evaluator shall take at least three photos and select the best one to create each eye artefact.

== Variations
=== Variation 1 (Eye 01-02)
*High Quality*

* T.1a, Type 2
* T.2, Type 2
* M.1, Type 2

== Prerequisite
The evaluator shall enroll test users first as described in the Eye Toolbox Overview. If the ST covers the multiple configurations for eye unlock, the same test should be done for all configurations.

== Presentation
The evaluator shall present a printed photo by hand as described in the Eye Toolbox Overview.

== Penetration Testing and Attack Potential Rating Suggestions
=== Penetration Testing Suggestion
The evaluator shall consider changing the following factors for penetration testing.

* Configuration of tool
+
The evaluator can change, for example, color effect of camera to change quality of the images. Such change may affect the texture of artefacts that may lead to false acceptance. 
* Presentation method
+ 
As described in BIOSD, the evaluator can change the distance between the artefact and the TOE. In addition to that, the evaluator can deliberately warp a printed photo, trying to simulate facial motion (Warped photo attack).

=== Attack Potential Rating Suggestion
The attack potential that is required to build the artefacts are summarized in the following table. See BIOSD Section 9 for more information about how to calculate the attack potential.
