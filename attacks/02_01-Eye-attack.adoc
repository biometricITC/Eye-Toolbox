= Attack Eye 02-01

== Attack type
Eye, digital photo attack

=== Total Number of Species
This attack has *2* species to be tested.

== Overview
The evaluator captures and displays a target user's eye on a screen and presents it to the TOE.

== Input
Target userâ€™s eyes are open and iris is mostly non-occluded.

== Tools
*Normal Quality*

* T.1a, Type 1
* M.2, Type 1

== Recipe
. The evaluator shall capture the eye image and display it on a screen. 

. The evaluator shall refer to publicly available information to change default settings of the camera (e.g., image resolution) to create clearer eye artefacts.

. The evaluator shall take at least three photos and select the best one to create each eye artefact.

== Variations
=== Variation 1 (Eye 02-02)
*High Quality*

* T.1a, Type 2
* M.2, Type 2

== Prerequisite
The evaluator shall enroll test users first as described in the Eye Toolbox Overview. If the ST covers multiple configurations for eye unlock, the same test shall be performed for all configurations.

== Presentation
The evaluator shall present the screen by hand as described in the Eye Toolbox Overview.

== Penetration Testing and Attack Potential Rating Suggestions
=== Penetration Testing Suggestion
The evaluator should consider changing the following factors for penetration testing.

* Configuration of tool
+
The evaluator may, for example, change color effects of the camera to change the quality of the images. Such change may affect the texture of artefacts that may lead to false acceptance. 
* Presentation method
+ 
As described in BIOSD, the evaluator may change the distance between the artefact and the TOE.

- Based on earlier work[2], the Evaluator should attempt to acquire images where the iris diameter is at least 75 pixels as the source.

=== Attack Potential Rating Suggestion
The attack potential that is required to build the artefacts are summarized in the following table. See BIOSD Section 9 for more information about how to calculate the attack potential.
