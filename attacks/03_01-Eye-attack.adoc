= Attack Eye 03-01

== Attack type
Eye, replay video attack

=== Total Number of Species
This attack has *2* species to be tested.

== Overview
The evaluator records and replays target user's eyes on a screen and present it to the TOE.

== Input
Target userâ€™s eyes are open and iris is mostly visible

== Tools
*Normal Quality*

* T.1a, Type 1
* M.2, Type 1

== Recipe
. The evaluator shall capture a 10 second video of the eyes and display it on a screen. 

. The evaluator shall refer publicly available information to change default setting of the camera (e.g. video resolution) to create clearer eye artefacts.

. The evaluator shall take at least three videos and select the best one to create each eye artefact.

== Variations
=== Variation 1 (Eye 03-02)
*High Quality*

* T.1a, Type 2
* M.2, Type 2

== Prerequisite
The evaluator shall enroll test users first as described in the Eye Toolbox Overview. If the ST covers the multiple configurations for eye unlock, the same test should be done for all configurations.

== Presentation
The evaluator shall present the screen by hand as described in the Eye Toolbox Overview.

== Penetration Testing and Attack Potential Rating Suggestions
=== Penetration Testing Suggestion
The evaluator shall consider changing the following factors for penetration testing.

* Configuration of tool
+
The evaluator can change, for example, color effect of camera to change quality of the videos. Such change may affect the texture of artefacts that may lead to false acceptance. 
* Presentation method
+ 
As described in BIOSD, the evaluator can change the distance between the artefact and the TOE.

=== Attack Potential Rating Suggestion
The attack potential that is required to build the artefacts are summarized in the following table. See BIOSD Section 9 for more information about how to calculate the attack potential.
